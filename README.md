## Info view

![info_view](.github/repo_assets/info_view.jpg "Info view")

Two vertical stacks in this view.

<p align="center">
  <b>Vertical stack 1</b>
</p>

### [Graph row I](https://github.com/agneevX/my-ha-setup/blob/readme-overhaul/lovelace_raw.yaml#L472)

* System Load - 5 minutes
* SSD used %
* Google Drive used space

### [Graph row II](https://github.com/agneevX/my-ha-setup/blob/readme-overhaul/lovelace_raw.yaml#L565)

* AdGuard Home - % of blocked ads
* AdGuard Home processing speed
* Latency - Speedtest.net

### [Graph row III](https://github.com/agneevX/my-ha-setup/blob/readme-overhaul/lovelace_raw.yaml#L657)

* CPU Temperature/Throttled state (host)
* CPU Temperature/Throttled state (Always-On server)
* Jitter - Speedtest.net

### [Graph row IV](https://github.com/agneevX/my-ha-setup/blob/readme-overhaul/lovelace_raw.yaml#L736)

* Download speed
* Upload speed

This is a custom sensor that uses the official Speedtest CLI as opposed to the `speedtest-cli` integration, which is very inaccurate.

  <b>Vertical stack 2</b>

### [Network throughput card](https://github.com/agneevX/my-ha-setup/blob/readme-overhaul/lovelace_raw.yaml#L806)

* Graphs network usage in the last hour

### [Network traffic card](https://github.com/agneevX/my-ha-setup/blob/readme-overhaul/lovelace_raw.yaml#L833)

* Total data in
* Total data out

This is another custom sensor that gets daily network usage from `vnstat` instead of using the rather [buggy](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/34804) internal integration.

### [Sensor graph](https://github.com/agneevX/my-ha-setup/blob/readme-overhaul/lovelace_raw.yaml#L867)

Pings my local ISP node and Cloudflare DNS. Very helpful in isolating network issues.

## Notes

* Screenshots may not be up-to-date.
* Entities beginning with `int` are "internal" entities that are used inside templates.
* Shutting down/Rebooting X200M involves a program called `Assistant Computer Control` that runs on the laptop.
  The cURL request calls a IFTTT webhook which in turn writes a specific word in a file inside OneDrive that the software is able to recognize and perform actions accordingly.
* The header that is used for separating cards is from the theme, [soft-ui](https://github.com/N-l1/lovelace-soft-ui).

## Special thanks

* to all authors above,
* and all the very helpful folks over at the HA Discord.
